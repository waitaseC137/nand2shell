# 🔗 From Switches to a Computer — Full Adder: The Carry Chain

> Last lesson you built a box, but it earned a "half" stamp: it produced a carry,
> but it couldn't accept one. In this lesson you'll complete the missing input. The box
> you build will be called a **full adder** — and, no exaggeration, this is the **brick**
> of addition: line up 64 of them side by side and you've built a circuit that adds
> 64-bit numbers.

> This is the most demanding build in the series so far. The difficulty isn't in the parts —
> they're all familiar — it's in the **way of thinking.** Before the right way, you'll
> also see a wrong one.

## Why Three Inputs?

Add 27 + 35 on paper and watch what your hand does:

```
      ¹        ← carry
      2 7
```
```
    + 3 5
    ─────
      6 2
```

- Rightmost digit: 7+5=12 → "write 2, **carry 1**". Here you added **two** things.
- Middle digit: 2+3+**1** → 6. Here you added **three** things: two digits + the incoming carry.

Every digit in the middle of the chain has three inputs. That is exactly what a full adder
is: the machine for that middle digit:

> **Full adder = a box that adds a + b + c** — where `c` is the **carry** coming in from
> the right neighbor. Its output is again two wires: `l` (write) and `h` (the new carry,
> heading to the left neighbor).

---

## The Box's Entire Logic in One Sentence

Adding three single-bit numbers is really just counting:

> 🔑 **COUNT how many 1s are among the three inputs. Write the resulting number in binary: h l.** That's all.

The count can come out 0, 1, 2, or 3 (there's nothing more than three inputs). You already
know the binary form of all four from lesson 04: `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`.

---

## Not Eight Rows, Four Cases

In the game an eight-row table will greet you. Don't let it scare you — group the rows by
the question "how many 1s are there?" and eight rows collapse to four:

| How many 1s? | Which rows | h l | In token language |
|:---:|---|:---:|---|
| 0 | 000 | `0 0` | no tokens |
| 1 | 001, 010, 100 | `0 1` | one 1-token |
| 2 | 011, 101, 110 | `1 0` | one 2-token |
| 3 | 111 | `1 1` | 2-token + 1-token |

Make two observations:

- **All three** of the rows with a single 1 give the same answer; so do the ones with two 1s.
  **Which** input is 1 doesn't matter at all — only the **count** matters. (Just like 7+5
  and 5+7 being the same.)
- The half adder's table had no `1 1` output — two inputs count to 2 at most. The only
  novelty the third input brings is that last row: 3 = `11`.

> 💡 Read the table one more time by **splitting it into floors**: separate the four rows
> where c=0 and look at h,l — out comes the **exact same table as the half adder's**. Makes
> sense: if the third basket is empty, a three-basket box has to behave like a two-basket
> box. This observation is the soul of the circuit you're about to build: inside the full
> adder, a half adder **lives.**

## The Wrong Way: "Let Me Add All the Pairs"

At this level the first idea that comes to mind is usually this (and it's worth trying — the
wrong way teaches too): *"I have a box that adds two things; so I'll add all the pairs:
a+b, a+c, b+c... then I'll combine them."*

You place three or four half adders, wire them up, and... you find yourself with a pile of
outputs and not a single "sum". Each box reports separately "how many 1s are in these two";
the reports repeat each other and nobody tells you the **overall total**. As the part count
grows, you get closer not to a solution but to a crowd of wires.

> ⚠️ The lesson here isn't a circuit lesson, it's a thinking lesson: **adding parts is not
> progress.** If your circuit is growing but your clarity is shrinking, go back to the table
> and look at the operation *itself*: how were you doing this job by hand?

---

## The Right Way: Like on Paper, In Order

Add 2 + 3 + 4 in your head and pay attention to **what you do**: "2+3 = 5... 5+4 = 9."
You didn't add all the pairs at once; **you added two, then added the third onto the
result.** Addition is sequential — the **answer** of one addition becomes the **input** of
the next.

You know this sentence from lesson 03.5: *the answer of one floor is the signal of the floor
above.* So then:

1. **First half adder:** let it add `a + b`.
2. **Second half adder:** let it add `c` onto the first one's result.

One subtlety remains: the first box's result is **two wires** (h and l). Which one do you
feed to the second box? Think in token language: `c` is a value **in 1-token units** (0 or 1
apple). The wire that goes on the same scale as it must also be in 1-token units: **`l`.**
(`h`, on the other hand, is in 2-token units — that belongs on a different scale, and will
wait off to the side.)

```
   a ──► [ add ] h₁ ─────────────────────┐  (2-token — waiting)
   b ──► [  1  ] l₁ ──► [ add ] h₂ ──────┤  (2-token — waiting)
                  c ──► [  2  ] l₂ ──────►│──► l  ✓ (ones place done)
                                          ▼
                                    last wire: h = ?
```

---

## The Last Wire: Two Carries, One Output

You have two h wires in hand (h₁, h₂) but the box has only one `h` output. Both wires shout
the same sentence: *"I found a pair!"* — the first in a+b, the second in remainder+c. But
your `h` output's question is: "**is there a pair inside?**" It doesn't care who found the pair.

"If at least one is shouting, h=1" — you know this sentence: **OR.**

But let's be meticulous; OR's table also has a `(1,1) → 1` row. What if both shout at once?
Two pairs = 4 apples would be needed; three inputs give 3 at most. Still, prove it on paper:
for h₁=1 you'd need a=b=1 → then l₁ = 0 → 0 and c enter the second box → the second box can
**never** find a pair. **Two shouts at the same time are impossible.** OR's one suspect row
will never be visited — use it with confidence.

> 💡 A subtle bonus: since the (1,1) case never occurs, **XOR** — which differs from OR only
> on that very row — would do the same job. Both pass. That two different gates can do the
> same task in a circuit feels strange at first — the secret is that they live in a world
> where their difference is never tested.

### The concrete consequence: you can build it without an OR gate at all

Let's not leave that bonus as talk. A half adder's `l` output **is already an XOR**
(lesson 05). Which means you can use the `add` box you already have in place of the OR:

```
   add₃ = add(h₁, h₂)      →  l₃  =  XOR(h₁, h₂)  →  the box's h output
```

You place a third half adder, feed it the two carries, and take its **`l` output**. The
`h₃` pin is left dangling — never used, because it is never 1.

| h₁ | h₂ | OR | XOR |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| ~~1~~ | ~~1~~ | ~~1~~ | ~~0~~ |

The struck-through row, as proved above, never happens. Because the **one row** where they differ is never visited, the two circuits behave
identically.

> 🔑 The real lesson here: a circuit's correctness depends not only on its gates but also on
> **which inputs are possible.** Knowing that a state is impossible buys you freedom in
> choosing gates. Using that freedom without proving it is dangerous — which is why we
> proved it on paper first and used it after.

## Three Separate ORs — Don't Mix Them Up

The sneakiest trap in this lesson isn't a circuit mistake, it's a **word** mistake. "OR"
comes up in three different places here and the three have nothing to do with each other:

| # | where | what |
|:-:|---|---|
| 1 | **inside XOR** | `XOR = (A OR B) AND (A NAND B)` — from lesson 03. Nothing to do with the full adder. |
| 2 | **while reading the table** | set apart the four rows where `a = 1` and `h = OR(b, c)` comes out. That's an **observation**, not a gate to build. |
| 3 | **in the circuit** | `OR(h₁, h₂)` — the one that combines the two carries. **This is the real one.** |

> ⚠️ The second is especially dangerous: after splitting the table into floors and making
> the observation `h = OR(b, c)`, it becomes very tempting to go to the circuit and wire `b`
> and `c` into an OR. **That's the wrong road.** That observation is a *description* of the
> `a = 1` floor; the circuit's `h` looks at all three inputs.
>
> The general rule: when you see two things carrying the same name, **say out loud, every
> single time, which one you're talking about.**

## 🎮 Now You Build It

**Task:** NandGame → **Full Adder** level.

Your directions: two `add`s (the game put your half adder into your box under that name —
03.5 at work), one OR. Build it, and try a few of the eight combinations by hand: each time
read out to yourself "how many apples → which tokens".

<details>
<summary>🔒 Solution schematic — try it yourself first, then open</summary>

1. `add₁`: inputs **a, b**.
2. `add₂`: inputs **the l of add₁** and **c**.
3. **OR**: inputs **the h of add₁** and **the h of add₂** → its output to the box's **h**.
4. **The l of add₂** → to the box's **l**.

Summary of the summary: *full adder = two half adders + one OR.* But you now say this
sentence not by rote but knowing the "why" of each of its wires — that's the difference.

**Alternative (without using an OR gate):** instead of the OR in step 3, place a third
`add`, feed `h₁` and `h₂` into its inputs, and wire its **`l` output** to the box's `h`.
Leave `h₃` dangling. The fact you proved above — that the two carries can never be 1 at the
same time — makes this circuit valid too. Both solutions are correct; the second is the one
that *uses* the proof.

</details>

## Closing: The Chain of 64

Look at the box you built one last time: it has a carry **input** called `c` and a carry
**output** called `h`. Which means these boxes... **can plug into each other.** One's h
becomes the c of the one to its left:

```
        ...  ◄─h─ [FA₂] ◄─h─ [FA₁] ◄─h─ [FA₀] ◄── (first carry: 0)
              b₂ a₂ │     b₁ a₁ │     b₀ a₀ │
                    l₂          l₁          l₀
```

Each box is one digit; the carry flows from right to left, just like on paper. Line up 8 of
them and you've built a circuit that adds 8-bit numbers; line up 64 and it adds 64-bit
numbers. The processor in your computer adds with the same arithmetic, but not with this
plain chain: it uses an arrangement that finds the carry faster. You'll see why in the
next lesson.

Building this chain yourself is the job of the next lesson (and the next level in NandGame):
**Multi-bit Adder.** See you there.

## Summary — Keep in Mind

```
☐ Full adder = a + b + carry-in. The machine for the MIDDLE digit on paper (three inputs!).
☐ All the logic: COUNT the 1s, write the number in binary (h l). 8 rows = 4 cases.
☐ Who is 1 doesn't matter, HOW MANY 1s matters. The c=0 floor = the half adder itself.
☐ Wrong-way lesson: adding parts isn't progress. Build it the way you do it by hand.
☐ Addition is SEQUENTIAL: add → then add onto the result. (A floor's answer, the floor above's signal.)
☐ The wire added to c is l (both in 1-token units); the h's are 2-token, waiting off to the side.
☐ Two h's can never be 1 at once (paper proof) → OR is enough to combine (XOR would pass too).
☐ A half adder's l output IS an XOR → a third `add` can replace the OR entirely.
☐ A circuit's correctness depends on which inputs are POSSIBLE, not only on its gates.
☐ Three separate ORs: inside XOR / the table observation / the real one in the circuit.
☐ Never wire b and c into an OR — that observation only describes the a=1 floor.
☐ The h output plugs into the neighbor's c input → a chain of 64 adds 64-bit numbers.
