# 🚪 From Switches to a Computer — XOR: The Tale of Two Bouncers

> The gates so far were one-sentence characters: "both," "at least one,"
> "the opposite." In this lesson, for the first time, you'll build a gate that asks for
> **two sentences at once**: XOR, the difference detector. Along the way you'll learn two things: what it means
> for gates to form a **team** — and the strange fact that will open the door to the next unit: XOR is, in fact,
> a secret **adder.**

> XOR is the series' "my brain is fried" stop. The burn is normal and temporary.

## Mission: The Difference Detector

**XOR** (from *exclusive or*), looks at its two inputs and asks a single
question: **"are you two different?"**

| a | b | XOR | reading |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| 0 | 0 | **0** | same → 0 |
| 0 | 1 | **1** | different → 1 |
| 1 | 0 | **1** | different → 1 |
| 1 | 1 | **0** | same → 0 |

You can read the same table through a second lens: the output is 1 only when there is **exactly one
1**. Both readings are correct; tuck the second one in your pocket, it'll come in handy this lesson.

## Why Isn't One Gate Enough?

Try the gates you have, one by one — which one matches this table?

- **Try OR:** "at least one." Same as XOR for the first three rows... but it blows it on the last row:
  OR(1,1)=1, while XOR wants it to be 0. ✗
- **Try NAND:** "not both." It nails the last row (1,1→0)... but it blows it on the first
  row: NAND(0,0)=1, while XOR wants it to be 0. ✗
- **AND**, **NOT** — try them, none of them can hit all four of the four rows.

Here's the reason: what XOR wants is **not a single condition, but the intersection of two conditions:**

1. "At least one of you be 1" *(eliminates 0,0)*
2. "But don't both of you be 1" *(eliminates 1,1)*

A single gate says a single sentence. A two-sentence job needs a **team**.

> 🔑 This is the first big design lesson in the series: a complex request breaks down into the **intersection
> of simple requests.** A gate for each simple request, and a gate for the intersection — and the job's
> done. You'll build every circuit from here on like this: first split into sentences, then hand out gates
> to the sentences.

## Two Bouncers, One Approval Desk

Now set up the story. Picture a club door; the rule for getting in is "exactly one of you two."
Two bouncers stand at the door, and each one enforces **a single rule**:

- **The OR bouncer:** *"At least one of you must have shown up."* — Doesn't approve an empty arrival (0,0).
- **The NAND bouncer:** *"But you can't both come in."* — Doesn't approve a paired arrival (1,1).

The **approval desk (AND)** inside does just one thing: **if both bouncers say "okay"**
it opens the door.

```
   a ──┬──────────► [ OR  bouncer ] ──┐
       │                              ├──► [ AND approval desk ] ──► XOR output
   b ──┴──────────► [ NAND bouncer ] ─┘
```

(a and b appear to both bouncers **at the same time** — the wires fork, no one waits their turn.)

---

## Verify the Table with the Bouncers

Run each of the four possibilities through the gates one by one:

| Arrivals (a,b) | OR bouncer | NAND bouncer | Approval desk (AND) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0, 0 — nobody | ✗ "nobody showed up" (0) | ✓ (1) | **0** — no entry |
| 0, 1 — one person | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | **1** — come on in |
| 1, 0 — one person | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | **1** — come on in |
| 1, 1 — a pair | ✓ (1) | ✗ "you can't both come in" (0) | **0** — no entry |

Four rows, four hits. XOR = **AND( OR(a,b), NAND(a,b) )** — but don't memorize this
formula; remember the story, and the formula rewrites itself.

> 💡 Did you notice: all three gates on the team are from earlier lessons — NAND from 01, OR and AND from 02. XOR
> isn't "a new invention," it's the **division of labor among old acquaintances.** Number of new parts: zero.

## XOR's Secret Identity (Trailer for the Coming Unit)

Take out that second reading you pocketed: XOR = "1 if there is exactly one 1."

Now answer this question: **what do you get if you add 0 and 1?** 1. And 1 and 1? 2 —
and in the binary world, the ones digit of the way 2 is written is **0** (we'll build up why,
step by step, in Unit 1). Now look at XOR's table once more:

| a | b | a+b | ones digit of the sum | XOR |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | **0** | **0** |

Exactly the same column. **XOR is the ones digit of the sum `a + b`.** This gate that
plays bouncer at the club door will, two lessons from now, be the heart of the circuit that lets the
computer do addition.

## 🎮 Now You Build It

**Mission:** NandGame → **Xor** level.

The story is in your hands: two bouncers + an approval desk. Look at the ready-made parts in your box (or, nand, and
— you built them all), and pull the wires. After you build it, try the four input combinations
**by hand** and each time watch which bouncer says "no" — that's when the circuit turns into
the story.

<details>
<summary>🔒 The logic of the solution — try it yourself first, then open</summary>

Fork `a` and `b` and feed them into **both OR and NAND**. Give the two gates' outputs to **AND**;
AND's output is XOR.

Extra observation: while your circuit is running, give it (1,1) and watch how the 0 at NAND's output
locks AND; then give it (0,0) and see the same lock on the OR side. Two bouncers, killing two
separate rows — if the table has four rows, two "no"s + two "yes"es is the whole tally.

## Summary — Keep in Mind

```
☐ XOR = difference detector: 1 if different, 0 if the same.
☐ Second reading: "1 if there is EXACTLY ONE 1" — don't forget this.
☐ One gate isn't enough, because the request is TWO sentences: "at least one" + "not both."
☐ The solution team: OR bouncer (eliminates 0,0) + NAND bouncer (eliminates 1,1) + AND approval desk.
☐ Design method: split a complex request into sentences, hand out gates to the sentences.
☐ XOR's secret identity: the ONES DIGIT of the sum a + b.
```
